  abstract  = {This paper considers the modeling of road congestion subject to peak-load demand. The standard model contains ambiguities and is poorly specified. These problems can be eliminated by working with a structural model that explicitly treats the congestion technology and drivers' behavioral decisions. The paper provides a detailed analysis of a particular structural model--William Vickrey's model of bottleneck congestion in the morning rush-hour auto commute, extended to treat elastic (i.e., price-sensitive) demand--and examines some economic implications of the structural approach.},

  abstract  = {One policy aimed at improving traffic flows in large cities requires vehicles to carry two or three passengers, usually in lanes or roads set aside for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) travel. Whether this actually increases speeds depends on how heavily the HOV roads are used and the availability of alternate routes. Hanna et al. took advantage of an abrupt policy change{\textemdash}the elimination of HOV rules{\textemdash}in Jakarta to collect the travel times from Google Maps for HOV and alternate routes before and after the change (see the Perspective by Anderson). They observed a serious worsening of traffic throughout the city.Science, this issue p. 89; see also p. 36Widespread use of single-occupancy cars often leads to traffic congestion. Using anonymized traffic speed data from Android phones collected through Google Maps, we investigated whether high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) policies can combat congestion. We studied Jakarta{\textquoteright}s {\textquotedblleft}three-in-one{\textquotedblright} policy, which required all private cars on two major roads to carry at least three passengers during peak hours. After the policy was abruptly abandoned in April 2016, delays rose from 2.1 to 3.1 minutes per kilometer (min/km) in the morning peak and from 2.8 to 5.3 min/km in the evening peak. The lifting of the policy led to worse traffic throughout the city, even on roads that had never been restricted or at times when restrictions had never been in place. In short, we find that HOV policies can greatly improve traffic conditions.},

We also find suggestive evidence of large effects for carbon monoxide, though results are imprecise. Finally, we check estimate sensitivity to nonclassical measurement error in local pollution and show that our IV results are robust to such concerns.},

This paper presents the findings of an exploratory analysis of the data collected in this test. The clustering of the day patterns from the FMS data revealed a large day-to-day variability of user behavior that could not be captured by a snapshot with a 1-day survey. Even the high cross-sectional variability from the larger sample size of a traditional survey would not have achieved the comprehensive set of heterogeneous patterns provided by FMS. Some common problems in traditional surveys—such as the underreporting of trips, the overestimation of travel times, and the inaccuracy of locations and times—can apparently be reduced by FMS. The FMS data have higher resolution and better accuracy compared with the HITS data. In addition, FMS is well suited to the collection of multiday data because additional costs are marginal and the user burden decreases over time. FMS offers a promising technology for the next generation of travel data collection.},

  abstract = {We show that temporary incentives can lead to lasting changes in people’s daily routines through a field experiment. In randomized controlled trials on Singapore’s subways, commuters in the treatment group received a full rebate of their fares for 10 weeks if they exited fare gates before the start of morning peak-travel time. The objective of the fare promotion was to alleviate peak-time congestion by encouraging commuters to travel prepeak. This promotion resembles an actual public program implemented in Singapore in 2013. Using participants’ fare cards, we obtained a rich data set for 60 weeks’ worth of trips. A difference-in-differences analysis reveals that the effect of the free-trip offer was modest but robust during the promotional period: on average, trips were 5.5\% more likely to end before the morning peak time. More encouragingly, the modest shift toward early travel strongly persisted even seven months after the end of the free-trip offer. This seemingly small shift could imply large financial savings on infrastructure investment. We find suggestive evidence that travel regularity and consistency during the promotion appear to be important for forging persistence. Data and the online appendix are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2731. This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics.},

  abstract = {Congestion costs in urban areas are significant and clearly represent a negative externality. Nonetheless, economists also recognize the production advantages of urban density in the form of positive agglomeration externalities. The long-run equilibrium outcomes in economies with multiple correlated but offsetting externalities have yet to be fully explored in the literature. Therefore, I develop a spatial equilibrium model of urban structure that includes both congestion costs and agglomeration externalities. I then estimate the structural parameters of the model using a computational algorithm to match the spatial distribution of employment, population, land use, land rents, and commute times in the data. Policy simulations based on the estimates suggest that congestion pricing may have ambiguous consequences for economic welfare.},

  abstract = {{Economists have long advocated road pricing as an efficiency-enhancing solution to traffic congestion, yet it has rarely been implemented because it is thought to create losers as well as winners. In theory, a judiciously designed toll applied to a portion of the lanes of a highway can generate a Pareto improvement, even before using the toll revenue. This paper explores the practical relevance of this theoretical possibility by using survey and travel time data, combined with a structural model of traffic congestion, to estimate the joint distribution of agent preferences over three dimensions—value of time, schedule inflexibility, and desired arrival time—and evaluate the effects of adding optimal time-varying tolls. I find that adding tolls on half of the lanes of a highway yields a Pareto improvement. Further, the social welfare gains from doing so are substantial—up to \\$1,740 per road user per year.}},

  abstract = {The standard economic model for analysing traffic congestion incorporates a relationship between speed and traffic flow. Empirical measurements indicate a region, known as hypercongestion, in which speed increases with flow. We argue that this relationship is unsuitable as a supply curve for equilibrium analysis because observed hypercongestion occurs as a response to transient demand fluctuations. We then present tractable models for handling such fluctuations, both for a straight uniform highway and for a dense street network such as in a central business district (CBD). For the CBD model, we consider both exogenous and endogenous time patterns for demand, and we make use of an empirical speed-density relationship for Dallas, Texas, to characterise hypercongested conditions. The CBD model is adaptable to any situation where accumulation of work to be processed becomes such a hindrance as to reduce outflow. © The London School of Economics and the University of Bath 2003},

I estimate demand for mobile phones as a function of individuals’ social networks, coverage, and prices, using transaction data from nearly the entire network of Rwandan mobile phone subscribers at the time, over 4.5 years. I estimate the utility of adopting a phone based on its eventual usage: subscribers pay on the margin, so calls reveal the value of communicating with each contact. I use this structural model to simulate the effects of two policies. A requirement to serve rural areas lowered operator profits but increased net social welfare. Developing countries heavily tax mobile phones, but standard metrics that neglect network effects grossly understate the true welfare cost in a growing network, which is up to 3.12 times the revenue raised. Shifting from handset to usage taxes would have increased the surplus of poorer users by at least 26\\%.}},

Consistent with a salience-based explanation for this toll increase, I find that under ETC, driving becomes less elastic with respect to the toll and toll setting becomes less sensitive to the electoral calendar.
